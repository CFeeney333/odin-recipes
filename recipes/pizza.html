            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>For sauce: Combine all sauce ingredients with 1/2 cup water in a medium
                     bowl; set aside for flavors to develop while making crust. 
                     Freeze remaining paste.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>For crusts: Combine 2 cups of flour with the dry yeast, 
                    sugar and salt. Add the water and oil and mix until well blended 
                    (about 1 minute). Gradually add enought remaining flour 
                    slowly, until a soft, sticky dough ball is formed.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Knead for about 4 minutes, on a floured surface, 
                    until dough is smooth and elastic. Add more flour, if needed. 
                    (If using RapidRise Yeast, let dough rest, covered, for 10 minutes.)
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Divide dough in half. Pat each half (with floured hands) into a 12-inch
                     greased pizza pan OR roll dough to fit pans.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Bake for 18 to 20 minutes until crusts are browned and cheese 
                    is bubbly. For best results, rotate pizza pans between top and 
                    bottom oven racks halfway through baking.
